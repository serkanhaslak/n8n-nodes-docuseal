# DocuSeal n8n Integration - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a set of n8n nodes to integrate with the DocuSeal API, enabling users to manage document templates, submissions, and receive webhook events within their n8n workflows.

## Required Components

### 1. API Credentials
We need to create a credentials file that supports both test and production environments:

- File: `credentials/DocusealApi.credentials.ts`
- Properties:
  - Test API Key
  - Production API Key
  - Environment selection (Test/Production)

### 2. Action Node
The main node for interacting with the DocuSeal API:

- File: `nodes/Docuseal/DocusealApi.node.ts`
- Capabilities:
  - `usableAsTool: true` for AI Agent integration
  - Environment selection (Test/Production)
  - Supports operations for templates and submissions

#### Operations
1. **Template Operations**:
   - List all templates
   - Get a template

2. **Submission Operations**:
   - List all submissions (with filtering options)
   - Get a submission
   - Create a submission (with fields support via JSON)
   - Archive a submission

### 3. Trigger Node
A webhook-based node for receiving DocuSeal events:

- File: `nodes/Docuseal/DocusealTrigger.node.ts`
- Capabilities:
  - Listen for submission events (created, completed, expired, archived)
  - Parse webhook data

### 4. Project Structure

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Base Setup
1. Create credentials file with dual environment support
2. Set up node structure and basic functionality
3. Implement environment selection in Action node

### Phase 2: API Node Implementation
1. Implement template operations
2. Implement submission operations
3. Add support for fields JSON in submission creation

### Phase 3: Trigger Node Implementation
1. Create webhook handling for submission events
2. Add webhook event filtering

### Phase 4: Tool Integration
1. Implement `usableAsTool` functionality
2. Test integration with AI Agent node

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
1. Test all operations with DocuSeal API
2. Document usage and configuration
3. Create README with setup instructions

## Technical Considerations

### API Authentication
- Use the `X-Auth-Token` header for authentication
- Switch API URLs based on environment selection

### Field Handling
- Support for JSON field specification in submission creation
- Map field values to DocuSeal API format

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for all API operations
- Handle rate limits and service unavailability

### Type Definitions
- Create proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Use appropriate n8n type definitions for node parameters

## Success Criteria
- All operations successfully tested with DocuSeal API
- Trigger node correctly processes webhook events
- Action node works as a tool in AI Agent context
- Environment switching works properly between test and production
- Clean, maintainable code following n8n patterns
